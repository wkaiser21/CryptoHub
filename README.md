This is a platform where one is able to track their cypto investments overtime. We will utilize topics from our course to be able to deveop this platform. (Sql databases, APIs, different types of requests, HTML/CSS, JavaScript development). Some of the features we hope to incorperate such as creating accounts, login into accounts, viewing live and historical data, adding to watch list, tracking potential investments, and filtering data.
